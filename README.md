# windows-parsing-sdk-m500-winforms
This is a sample app using our Parsing SDK with the M500 Scanner.



To use the parsing SDK, you must get the dlplib.lic license file in the same bin directory as the IDScanNet.dlplib.dll

The M500 SDK can be retrieved here. http://e-seek.us/e-seek-M500.html

It is reccomended to change default log directory to the "logs" directory. this can be done in M500Form.cs.
You can also manually overwrite the default log directory within the sample settings.
